/* This programm emulates an IDE controller of a compact flash card (cf) in True IDE mode.
*
* Following restrictions apply to this simulation:
* ---	The simulation doesn't care about the mapping between the I/O IDE registers in the hosts main memory
*	and his internal registers (in other words the physical connection). The I/O registers of the host are
*	not used. A read or write to the hosts registers results in a direct read or write of the internal drive 
*	registers. The signal management nessecary to provide this in reality is ignored.
*---	A IDE controller can have more than one device attached. 
*	The device selection is done by setting the DEV bit (bit 4) of the SDH_REGISTER. Anyway the registers are 
*   	always written to any attached drive. The drives embbeded controller then decides wether to take action or 
*   	not. The DEV bit is expected to be set to 0 and is further ignored. It is always assumed that device0 
*	should execute the given commands.
*---	The Simulator does not support Power Management Features: The device is always expected to be powered up. 
*	Other modes like Sleep Mode are not supported. The power up itself, which does a lot of things like 
*	internal diagnostic, is not simulated either. Only the register initialization must be done by calling 
*	initializeIDEDevice() once. The qnice simulator should do this before interpreting any assembler code.
*---	Only a small subset of the possible and partly required (at least by the cf or ATA specification) 
*	commands are supported:
* 		Read Sector(s)
*       Read Verify
* 		Request Sense
*		Write Sector(s) 
*       Write Verify 
*---	The BSY bit is set like in a real drive although you can never verify that in assembler: when the next 
*	assembler directive is interpreted the BSY bit has been reset to zero (we would need multithreading to
*	implement it otherwise). Anyway the BSY bit should always been checked in the assembler code because with
*	a real drive it may take some time until a command is executed or aborted and the BSY bit is reseted to 0.
*---	Currently only CHS addressing is supported even though according to cf spec LBA should be supported too.
